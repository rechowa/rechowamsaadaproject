<h1>MSAADA PROJECT<h1>
  Hello sowcoders! wellCOME to MSAADA PROJECT<br>
   About a half of people living in Bungoma require special needs.
  msaada is a project  institution that is helping people with special needs such as those  with disabilities and poor
  children and those with disabilities such <aside class="pink">

  </aside> to get accessed to their needs <br>
  msaada has come up with theidea of helping those in need .many people are suffering because they dont have people to take care
  of them.with msaada project all people will be equal and no more suffering will be in Bungoma county.
  I will be providing education and health services to them.They have special needs such:
  <ul>
    <li>health services</li>
    <li>food</li>
    <li>safety </li>
    <p>

      These people are realy disturbed both mentally and physically because of their background<br>
      The community is the one that is mostly affected.The community is affected in ways such as:
  <ol>
    <li>independancy</li>
    <li>overdependancy</li>
    <li>illetracy</li>
    <h2>overdependancy</h2>
    Those who need help depend on others most and less resourses will be made this programme will reduce that<br>
    I will also help them get education so that they depend on themselves<br>
    <h2>  independancy</h2>
  Those who are related to the family are rejected by others and they are not given oppotunity to do anything<br>
  <h3>mission<h3>
    my mission is to see that all people are helped and the society is out of shame .
    provide those with disabilities wheelchairs and handcafs to support them in walking.
     They will have access to both basic and secondary needs<br>I will be very happy
      if i see my project prospering<br>
      These are products that i will be offering to them:
      <ul>
      <li>wheelchairs</li>
      <li>handcafs</li>
      <li>spectacals</li>
    </ul>
